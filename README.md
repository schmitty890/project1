# project1

## Environments

- [The Project 1 site prod](https://golden-liger-8f32da.netlify.app/) for demo.
  This is the production site
- [The Project 1 site develop](https://courageous-otter-b1cb69.netlify.app/) for demo.
  This is the development site, where testing happens to ensure everything is good before moving to production

## Purpose

This is a test team project website! The purpose for this site is to practice not only coding html, css and javascript, but to learn how to collaborate with others via stories in github as well as get more comfortable with different libraries and frameworks and coding techniques for fun!

## Tech Used

<b>Built with</b>

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/)

- HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery

# Getting Started

- Clone the GitHub repo to your machine.
- Run the index.html file on your live server for development.
- 🎉Happy developing!🎉

# Development 👨‍💻

Once you've cloned the project, start your live server off your index.html file.

### Branching process

- Master is a 🔒protected branch🔒. This means we need at least 1 approval before we merge into our master branch. (having the master branch protected helps so we know for sure what is going into master, and noone can accidentally push code to it and break our site)
- Develop will be the branch we create branches off of. Develop will be merged into master at the end of every day.
- This screenshot 👇 illustrates this process
- Feature A and Feature B are branches where we code our tasks. Once finished with making your edits, we merge that branch into develop. At the end of everyday, develop gets merged into master.
- Then develop is updated with the latest version of master, and the process happens all over again.

### Find a bug or want to add an issue? 🕵️

- Document what the issue is, if you can find the root problem, write whatever you have down
- Go to the Issues tab, create a new issue
- Assign it to yourself if you want to work on that issue, or leave it blank and someone else can assign themselves to it if they want to take on the challenge
- Add a label to it. Most are going to be bugs or enhancement
